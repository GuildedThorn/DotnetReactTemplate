# Thanks for checking out my work

This is my react + tailwind / dotnet + mongodb + auth template, this is not as plug in play as many templates you might find on the internet, if you want to pull this for an open source project please note you will be renaming a lot of namespaces and file references.

That being said this does help those who want to enable cookie support in their dotnet + react apps, and want something that is httponly, same site strict, etc.

I do not have oauth in this project, and I might add it soon depending on feedback from any users. I have basic roles support for endpoints, and have a section for individual user permissions in the jwt creation process (although please note this functionality is not yet added to any of the controllers)

The styling is very barebones, but i do have ShadCN imported and ready to setup with a sidebar, components etc, this project does use react router dom, and my examples use fetch and not ajax (not needed unless you do file uploads) so screw you knuckleheads :)
